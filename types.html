                    <p><b><u>Invasive ductal carcinoma:</u></b><br><br>
                         The cancer cells begin in the ducts and then grow outside the ducts into other parts of the breast tissue. Invasive cancer cells can also spread, or metastasize, to other parts of the body. <br>
                        <br><b><u>Invasive lobular carcinoma:</u></b><br><br>
                         Cancer cells begin in the lobules and then spread from the lobules to the breast tissues that are close by. These invasive cancer cells can also spread to other parts of the body.

                    <br><br>
                    <p>Breast cancer is among the most common cancers affecting millions worldwide. Early detection significantly increases the chances of successful treatment, making awareness initiatives like ours an integral part of the solution.</p>
                    <br>
                       <br> <b>1.</b> When breast cancer is detected early, and is in the localized stage, the 5-year relative survival rate is 90%. Early detection saves lives! <br>
                       <br> <b>2.</b> Knowledge Empowerment: The more we know about breast cancer, its symptoms, risk factors, and the importance of regular screening, the better prepared we are to take proactive steps. <br>
                       <br> <b>3.</b> Support and Solidarity: For those undergoing treatment, or living as survivors, community support can play a transformative role in their journey. <br>
